#Play Nine

This was done as a tutorial following **_"React.js: Getting Started" from Pluralsight_**.

## How To Play
The game has three sections. One section shows a random number of stars. Another section shows the numbers from 1 - 9. 
The third section shows your selected numbers.

The aim of the game is to select numbers so that the sum of the numbers selected match the number of stars shown. 
To win you need to make sure that all numbers (1 - 9) have been selected. 
If you do not have an option of matching the number of stars shown, you can refresh the stars section for a maximum of 5 times.

You win the game when you have succesfully selected all the numbers. If you are not able to select all the numbers even after the 5 refreshes then you lose.
